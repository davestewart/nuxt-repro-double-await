# Nuxt Content - Double Await repro

This repo demonstrates a case where making two `await`ed calls to Content inside `useAsyncData()` fails to return a response.

It contains four examples, as outlined [here](https://github.com/davestewart/nuxt-repro-double-await/blob/main/content/index.md).

## Setup

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

View the content on:

- http://localhost:3010
